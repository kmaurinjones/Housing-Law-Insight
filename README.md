# Housing Law Insight Dashboard

### Overview
The Housing Law Insight Dashboard is a web application designed to showcase the potential of Data Science and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the legal domain. This project is a demonstration of how these technologies can be utilized to analyze eviction decisions in Ontario, Canada, providing insights into the factors that influence judicial outcomes.

### Key Features
- **Data Extraction and Visualization**: The app utilizes a fine-tuned NLP model to extract over 250 pieces of information from eviction case files, which are then structured and visualized for easy interpretation.
- **Predictive Modeling**: A custom Machine Learning model predicts the likelihood of various housing law case outcomes based on the structured data, offering a glimpse into potential case decisions.
- **Data Exploration**: Users can explore anonymized and aggregated case data to identify patterns and trends across numerous factors involved in eviction cases.

### Educational and Historical Insight
This app serves an educational purpose, illustrating the impact of data-driven approaches on legal transparency and access to justice. It is intended for historical analysis and is not a substitute for legal advice. 

### Ethical Considerations
The data used in this project has been anonymized as much as possible to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. The results provided by the predictive model are for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for decision-making in actual legal cases.

### Caution
This application is provided as-is for educational purposes. It is a tool to foster discussion and understanding of how data science can intersect with law, rather than a production-ready solution.
