### 3. **Understanding Your Results**

**Prediction Breakdown**

In this section, we’ll walk you through the predictions made by the Housing Law Insight Dashboard, helping you to understand what each prediction means and how it might apply to your situation.

For each possible outcome in your case, the model has provided a probability. This probability represents the model’s confidence that a particular outcome will occur, based on the information you provided and the patterns observed in historical eviction cases.

**How to Interpret the Probabilities**

- **Example:** Let’s say the model predicts a 70% probability of eviction. This means that in 7 out of 10 cases with similar circumstances to yours, an eviction occurred. However, it’s important to remember that a 70% probability does not guarantee that an eviction will happen; it simply indicates that, historically, eviction was the most common outcome in similar cases.

- **Multiple Outcomes:** The model doesn’t just consider one outcome—it provides probabilities for several possible outcomes. This could include scenarios such as full eviction, conditional eviction, or dismissal of the case. Each outcome will have a corresponding probability, allowing you to see which outcomes are more or less likely.

**Comparing Your Case**

One of the most valuable features of the Housing Law Insight Dashboard is its ability to compare your specific case to the average cases in the dataset. This comparison can give you insight into how typical or atypical your situation might be. 

- **Average Case Statistics:** The report will provide average statistics for cases similar to yours, such as average rent, common reasons for eviction, or typical case outcomes. This allows you to see how your case aligns with or deviates from the norm.

- **Outcome Likelihood vs. Average:** We’ll show you how the probabilities in your case compare to those in average cases. For example, if the average probability of eviction in similar cases is 50% but your case has a 70% probability, this suggests that certain factors in your case are making eviction more likely.

By understanding these comparisons, you can better grasp where your case stands in relation to others, which can be helpful in planning your next steps. Remember, the model is a tool to assist you in making informed decisions, but it should not replace the advice of a legal professional. If you have questions or concerns about your case, we recommend consulting with a lawyer for personalized guidance.
