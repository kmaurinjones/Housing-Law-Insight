### 7. Feature Importance in the XGBoostClassifier Model

---

**Understanding Feature Weight in XGBoostClassifier**

In the context of the XGBoostClassifier model, feature weight refers to the importance of each feature in making predictions. The weight value is derived from the number of times a particular feature is used to split the data across all trees in the model. A higher weight indicates that the feature plays a more critical role in the model's decision-making process, influencing the outcome predictions more significantly than features with lower weights. 

In this section, we will examine the features identified by the model and explore how they impact the predictions.

### Exploring Feature Impact: How Adjusting Key Features Can Influence Model Predictions

---

The XGBoostClassifier model used in the Housing Law Insight Dashboard is highly sensitive to the values of specific features. By adjusting these key features, it’s possible to significantly influence the model’s predictions, potentially swinging the outcome from one likely result to another. This section explores how varying certain features can impact the predicted outcomes of eviction cases.

### Experimenting with Feature Values

By adjusting these and other key features in hypothetical scenarios, users can explore how different circumstances might influence the model’s predictions. For example, setting values that reflect a tenant who has received a long notice period, proposed a payment plan, and has legal representation may result in predictions that favor outcomes where the tenant remains in their home. Conversely, features indicating a short notice period, no payment plan, and a history of late payments could swing the prediction towards eviction.

This exploration of feature values is not only educational but can also provide valuable insights into which aspects of a case are most critical in determining its outcome. Understanding these dynamics can help tenants, landlords, and legal professionals strategize more effectively by focusing on the factors that the model identifies as most influential in its predictions.
