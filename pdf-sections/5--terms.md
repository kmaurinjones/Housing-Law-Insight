### 5. **Legal Terms Glossary**

---

Understanding legal terminology is key to interpreting the predictions and the context of your eviction case. Below is a glossary of common legal terms related to eviction cases that you may encounter in this report. 

1. **Full Eviction**: An order by the LTB requiring the tenant to vacate the rental unit entirely, typically due to non-payment of rent or significant breaches of the rental agreement.

2. **No Eviction, Payment Plan**: An outcome where the tenant is not evicted but is required to follow a payment plan to repay overdue rent. The tenant can remain in the rental unit as long as they adhere to this plan.

3. **Conditional Eviction**: A decision where the tenant may remain in the rental unit under specific conditions set by the LTB. Failure to meet these conditions could lead to eviction.

4. **Dismissal**: The LTB dismisses the landlord’s application for eviction, meaning no eviction occurs, and the tenant remains in the rental unit without any additional conditions or orders.

5. **Relief From Eviction**: An outcome where the LTB grants the tenant relief from eviction, often due to extenuating circumstances, allowing the tenant to stay in the rental unit despite the landlord’s request for eviction.

6. **Abatement**: A reduction in rent ordered by the LTB, typically due to issues such as maintenance problems or other breaches of the landlord’s responsibilities.

7. **Rent Adjustment**: An order from the LTB to adjust the amount of rent the tenant pays, which could be an increase or decrease based on specific circumstances.

8. **Postponement**: A decision by the LTB to delay the hearing or the eviction, giving the tenant more time to address the issues at hand.
